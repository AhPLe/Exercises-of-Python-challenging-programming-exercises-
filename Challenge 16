#Question 16
#Level 2

#Question:
#Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list.
## the given problem seems wrong, the output now just outputs the odd numbers
##the change to make them square is line 26, from str(tempInt) to str(tempInt*tempInt)
#The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
#Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
#Then, the output should be:
#1,3,5,7,9

import importlib
import TestingInput

print("Input a comma-separated sequence of numbers, the odd numbers will be returned square")
InputValue = input()
output = ""
if TestingInput.CommaNumberStr(InputValue):
    #input is good
    InputList = InputValue.split(",")
    for i in range(0, len(InputList)):
        tempInt = int(InputList[i].strip())
        if (tempInt%2 != 0):
            output = output + "," + str(tempInt)
        else:
            continue
else: print("you did not input a correct string, exiting")
output = output.strip(",")
print(output)
