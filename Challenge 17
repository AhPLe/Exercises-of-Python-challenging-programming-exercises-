##I realize this is a bit long, but I initially tried to use just the input() function instead of storing in a text file
##It seemed longer than necessary to find out how to take inputs with line end characters, so I switched to text
##that said, the rest of the program works and I may come back to clean up, make it shorter, or make it more legible.
##then again, these are just challenges so it could also just be good enough as is.

#Question 17
#Level 2

#Question:
#Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account
#based a transaction log from console input.
#The transaction log format is shown as following:
#D 100
#W 200

#D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
#Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#D 300
#D 300
#W 200
#D 100
#Then, the output should be:
#500
